# Man-United-Fan-Page
This project is basic html/css site.
This is the first Project that is not part of the college's final assignments of required courses.It's the first time that i messing around with html.The baby steps i set to my self were about touching the basic elements of html/css such as: nesting tags, reference to other pages, organize and hierarchy of back-end files, integrate several languages and technolgies, flexibility to changes, readabilty of the code and easy understading what element responsible of.


as i demand from myself, this project was not completed as i wanted, but this is enough for current. The next project should be a real bomb compared to this one. site.
